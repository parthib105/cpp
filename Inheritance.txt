INHERITANCE - Overview
 1. reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
 2. In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional feature to it.
 3. Reusing classes save time and money
 4. Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort
    of developing and debugging the same thing again.

WHAT IS INHERITANCE IN C++
 1. The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using INHERITANCE
 2. We cna reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it
 3. The existing class is called as the 'Base Class'
 4. The new class which is inherited is called as the 'Derived Class'.
 5. Reusing classes saves time and money
 6. There are different types of inheritance in C++

FORMS OF INHERITANCE IN C++
 1. Single Inheritance 
        => A derived class with only one 'Base Class'

        A ----> B

 2. Multiple Inheritance
        => A derived class with more than one 'Base Class'

                A       B
                |       |
                ---------
                    |
                    C

 3. Hierarchical Inheritance
        => Several derived classes from a single 'base Class'

                    C
                ----------
                |        |
                A        B    

 4. Multilevel Inheritance
        => Deriving a class from already derived class

        A ----> B ----> C

 5. Hybrid Inheritance
        => It is a combination of 'multiple' and 'multilevel' inheritance
        => A class is derivec from two classes as in 'multiple' inheritance
        => However, one of the parent classes is not a 'Base Class'
                 
                        A
                   ------------
                   |          |
                   B          C
                   |          |
                   ------------
                        |
                        D
