Object oriented Programming

1. Object -> It's an ENTITY consisting of STATE/PROPERTIES and BEHAVIOUR.
2. Why object? -> To improve our programs's Readability, Managebility, Extensibility
3. Class -> User defined data type, Object -> instance of a Class

Access Modifiers : 3 types -> public, private, protected, default -> private

Default constructor uses shallow copy

Shallow Copy : accessing same memory while copying
Deep Copy : different memory locations while copying

DEstructor : for de-allocating memory

statically object created -> destructor is automatically called
dynamically object createxd -> destructor is called manually
