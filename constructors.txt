CONSTRUCTORS IN DERIVED CLASSES
 1. We can use constructors in derived class in C++
 2. If base class constructor doesn't have any arguments, there is no need of any constructor in derived class.
 3. But if there are one or more arguments in the base class constructor, derived calss need to pass arguments to the base class constructor.
 4. If both base and s=derived classes have constructors, base class constructor is executed first.

CONSTRUCTORS IN MULTIPLE Inheritance
 1. In multiple inheritance, base classes are consturcted in the order in which they appear in the class declaration.
 2. In multilevel inheritance, the consturctors are executed in the order of inheritance.

SPECIAL SYNTAX
 1. C++ supports an special syntax for passing arguments to multiple base classes
 2. The constructor pf the derived class receives all the arguments at once and then will pass the calls to the respective base classes
 3. The body is called after all the constructors are finished executing


Derived-Constructor(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...) : Base1-Constructor(arg1, arg2), Base2-Constructor(arg3, arg4)
{
    .....
}

SPECIAL CASE OF VIRTUAL BASE CLASSES
 1. The constructors for virtual base classes are inbvoked before an non-virtual base class
 2. If there are multiple virtual base classes, they are invoked in the order declared
 3. Any non-virtual base class are then constructed before the derived class constructor is executed
