STL - Standard Template Library
 => Library of Generic Classes and Functions

COMPONENTS : 
 1. Containers
    => objects which stores data
    => use template classes
    - TYPES OF CONTAINERS:
        => sequence containers
            -> stores data in linear fashion
            -> Ex. vector, list, dequeue

        => associative containers
            -> direct access, fast access
            -> Ex. set, multiset, map, multimap

        => derived containers
            -> real world modelling
            -> Ex. stack, queue, priority queue
 
 2. Algorithms
    => like sorting, searching etc., i.e, to process data using template functions 
 
 3. Iterators
    => an object points to an element in a Containers
    => handled just like pointers
    => connects algorithms with containers
