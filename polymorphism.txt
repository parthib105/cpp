POLYMORPHISM:
  - one name and multiple form
  - ex. function overloding, operator overloding

TYPES:
  1. compile time polymorphism
        - object is bounded by function call during compilation
          i.e., during compile time decision is made which function to be called
        - This is achieved by Function overloding, Operator overloding 
  
  2. run time polymorphism
        - Achieved by virtual functions
        - Defer the function call after running the code
        - after the run of code, it decides which function to be called according to pointers
